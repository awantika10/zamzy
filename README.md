<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project
# Problem Statement 

- Women usually find it difficult to express their views in socitey, often in social media and their towards their families. They face many changes in their life emotionally and physically. There experiences are something which 1 in billion women always faces in her lives. 
- Women usually finds it very difficult to connect with their male friends or families. This could be either emotional fatigness or physical health.
-  Women often end up getting trapped in unconscious patterns of behaviour, which are detrimental to their growth and success.
-  Media and culture lack authentic representations of women; from products we cannot use to stories we do not identify with.

# Solution
- We have come with an innovative approach of a product known as "Zamzy" which encourages women communities to share their stories and journeys, which help in breaking those archaic patterns.
- They allow women to be vulnerable and there is a great sense of empowerment in being vulnerable, knowing it will never prove baleful to their own development.
- Women communities become spaces where women can share career advice and create opportunities for each other, together.

# Impact
- Online communities are committed to supporting women in global supply chains, and are set out to understand how to address the challenges holding back progress on womenâ€™s economic empowerment.
